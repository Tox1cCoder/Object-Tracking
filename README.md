# Object Tracking

Object Detection using YOLO and OpenCV.

The Video , Images, Detected Videos, Detected Images used can be found in the Gallery directory.

This YOLO object Detection project can detect 80 objects(i.e classes) in either a video or image. 
The full list of the classes can be found in the labels directory as a textfile.
Since a pretrained Model is made use of, the Yolo.v3 configuration can be found in the config_n_weights directory.
YOLO.v3 weights is very heavy, about 200mb and should be downloaded.
Click on this [link](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/18TTdmFp5PDy1IfqLBIYlqF4bE2jvXeI1) to download the folder containing both Yolo.v3 weights and Yolo.v3 configuration.This folder should be kept in the same directory as main.py
